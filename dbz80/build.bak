rem Z80 Debugger build routine
rem
rem The files are:
rem
rem dbz80  - This is the main code
rem cpmio  - Contains the CP/M I/O package
rem dirio  - Contains direct I/O to hardware,the Polymorphic card for S-100
rem oszio  - Contains the OS/Z I/O package
rem loader - Contains the dbz80 relocator and symbols loader (CP/M specific).
rem
rem To generate an operating/environment specific package, one of the I/O 
rem modules is linked to the back of the debugger. If required, the loader
rem is linked to the front of the package. Because (in this version) the
rem loader cannot relocate, the main dbz80 package is located differently
rem than the loader, then the two are concatenated.
