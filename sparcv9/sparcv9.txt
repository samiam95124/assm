                             SPARC V9 ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE

OVERVIEW

Describes the exact language as input by the IP Sparc V9 assembler.

ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES

The following pseudo ops are oriented specifically for SPARC V9.

Directive           Meaning
================================================================================
float				Enables the specification of floating point instructions.
                    Note that msv9 instruction enables floating point by default.
nfloat              Disables the specification of floating point instructions.
msv7                Restricts the instruction set to SPARC V7.
msv8                Restricts the instruction set to SPARC V8.
msv9                Restricts the instruction set to SPARC V9.
defw				Define Sparc specific word format, 32 bit big endian.
defhw				Define SPARC specific half word format, 16 bit big endian.
defdw               Define SPARC specific double word format, 64 bit big endian.
defqw               Define SPARC specific quad word format, 64 bit big endian.
deffd               Define SPARC specific double float, 64 bit big endian.
deffq               Define SPARC specific quad float, 128 bit big endian.

The standard pseudo op deflf defines the SPARC V9 Quad Precision floating point
format.

SIMILARITY OF IP SPARC V9 TO STANDARD SPARC V9

Aside from the pseudo ops, every effort is made to keep compatibility with 
standard SPARC assembly language as defined by SPARC International, Inc. This
includes implementation of the following features:

o Register names are introduced with a leading "%". Register names can be reused
in equates and sets.

o Operand formats are destination right, that is, the destination register or
memory location is on the right side of the operand list.

o Bracketed format is used for register indirect operands:

   [reg]
   [reg+imm]

o "Synthetic" instructions are supported.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IP SPARC V9 AND STANDARD SPARC V9

These are SPARC V9 conventions that are NOT supported in the IP SPARC V9
assembler.

o The use of embedded commas in the memonic is not supported. IP SPARC V9
instructions are written without commas:

SPARC V9            IP
=============================================
brgez,a,pt          brgezapt

o Predefined values are NOT written with a preceeding pound ("#") 
character:

SPARC V9            IP
=============================================
#page               page

Predefined values in IP SPARC V9 assembler are ordinary equates and sets.

o C style comments are not supported.
