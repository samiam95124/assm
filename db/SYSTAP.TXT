                     SYSTEM TAP IDEA

Simple: We wish to provide a general means to branch from simulated tasks to
the host operating system for advanced services. We also wish to make this
interface as fast as possible, and extensible for the future, when we may be
using it to test program runs across architechures.
We define a "system tap" instruction, that is an instruction code that is
competely illegal in the target processor. This is followed by a system
function code. The parameters are then received in registers.
The calling functions are essentially those of the RP universal set, added
to as need be.
