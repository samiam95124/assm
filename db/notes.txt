                               NOTES FOR DB

1. Control-c needs to be handled, and ignored on the command line, and used to
stop runs.

2. Control-c on the prompt after a few command executes spills '>' characters
on the terminal.

3. The dump command, when only given a start parameter, does not dump anything.
It should dump at least a single byte.
