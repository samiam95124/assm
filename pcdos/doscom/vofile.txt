                          VO FILE SYSTEM

OVERVIEW

The standard file system for VO is based on progressive indexing (see previous
work with progressive indexing). The first sector on the disk is reserved for
the bootstrap sector. The second sector is the prime root directory sector.

The format of the boot sector is not specified, and it is up to the target
system to specify its format. Further, most systems have their own boot format
for the first sector already specified.

All space on the VO file system is held under the directory structure. 
Directories can be any length, and a directory file can be specified within
another directory, so that the directory can be tree structured. Directory loops
and cross linkages are not allowed, so that the allocation and structure of the
file tree is consistent, and can be examined top down always.
