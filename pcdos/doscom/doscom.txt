                 CONSTRUCTING PROGRAMS FOR THE DOS .COM MODEL

Constructing a DOS .COM program is quite simple. .COM files are direct images
of the program, and are identical to the contents of the .OBJ file output by
LN after all the references are complete.

The program should be located at $100. A typical link may appear as:

        ln test=test /ps=$100

Which creates the .SYM and .OBJ files. If the link goes without error and
produces no undefineds, it is ready to run. To create a run file, simply copy
it to the .COM file:

        copy /b test.obj test.com

Note that DOS will refuse to load a file larger than 64kb long, so it is not
possible to create .COM files larger than that (under the 80386, it would
otherwise be possible to create such a file).

System calls in a .COM file are made entirely via software interrupts.
